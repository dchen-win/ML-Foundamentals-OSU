    "Implement `fit`, `_d_cost_function_w` and `_d_cost_function_b`, to represent an appropriate gradient descent algorithm that trains our multiple linear regression model. When complete, you should see the model produce price predictions that \"best fit\" the simple training data above. Here are some suggestions for completing your implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Modify the existing MultipleLinearRegressor class definition above.\n",
    "2. Run your code frequently, using _Run All_ and running the code in the \"Test Run\" code cell above.\n",
    "2. Draw inspiration from the UnivariateLinearRegressor - the structure of gradient descent remains the same, we just need to handle a vector of weights and features.\n",
    "3. Consider replicating the small steps taken in the exploration. Start with `fit`.\n",
    "4. Review the Exploration content and familiarize yourself with the expressions for computing the partial derivatives with respect to `w` and `b` when using a _vector_ of weights and features.\n",
    "5. Implement just _one_ of the partial derivative functions first, and verify that the prediction output has changed.\n",
    "6. For convenience, you can create a new code cell with the class definition, data, instantiation and usage all in one code cell if you wish. But when complete, please be sure that you remove it, and that the MultipleLinearRegressor class definition above is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best tip for thinking about this challenge is to become intimately familiar with the expressions for computing the gradients, or partial derivatives, for w and b. Then, try first working out on paper how your implementation of these computations might work, given the vector of weights and features."

    "\n",
    "The problem solving process:\n",
    "1) Started with fit function first. The logic is similar with UnivariateLinearRegressor and the only difference between them is in multiplelinear regression, there will be the vector of regression coefficients or weights associated with that. So I write a for loop when I do self.w.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) I created nested for loop inside another for loop to calculate vector of regression coefficients w and the other for loop is to calculate predict errors. But in the UnivariateLinearRegressor, there is only one indepent variable, for loop is used for calculate the predict errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) I write function to calculate b.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, I test my result. However, it returns the negative values for the predict price. I go back to change the learning rate to a really small number.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several limitations: \n",
    "1) The size of the training dataset is small and it is hard to find the pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) We also need to scale the datasets to get better performance. But since the size of the training is so small. Scaling the dataset won't help much.\n",

In our case, we will experiment with the scikit-learn [SGDRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html), a linear regression model that trains via stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Please be sure to take a look at [the documentation for SGDRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.SGDRegressor.html).\n",

If you put in the effort to try to improve the SGDRegressor, describe what you did and what led you to try what you did, and describe the results. Conclude with some statements or questions about the model score, the model being used, and the data set. Make suggestions about what you might do next to either improve the score or conclude with an explanation of whether you would continue to use a linear model.\n",

    "1) In the exploring dataset process, I use statistic method to explore the datasets to check out the min, max, count, etc to help me better understand the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) In the pre-processing process and training process, we use StandardScaler to scale the datasets. It ensures that the input features are appropriately scaled before being passes to the SGDRegressor.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) In the step 5 model validation, it turns out the negative values. I adjust the model by changing the hyperparameter in the model. I found out that the learning rate eta0 is the most important hyperparameter for a linear regression after tried several differnent learning rate.\n",

    "Next steps:\n",
    "1) Apply more training and test datasets to feed into the mode. There is not enough data to help the model to learn the pattern.\n",
